# GitHub Push Instructions

To push this repository to GitHub, follow these steps:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name the repository "curly"
   - Add a description: "JSON-Based Wrapper for cURL"
   - Choose either public or private visibility
   - Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
   - Click "Create repository"

2. Connect your local repository to GitHub:
```bash
# From the curly directory
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/curly.git
```

3. Push your code to GitHub:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

4. Verify that your code has been pushed:
   - Go to https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/curly
   - You should see all your files and commits

5. Future pushes can be done with:
```bash
git push
```

## Using SSH Instead of HTTPS

If you prefer to use SSH instead of HTTPS for GitHub authentication:

```bash
# From the curly directory
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/curly.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter authentication issues:
- For HTTPS: You might need to provide your GitHub username and personal access token
- For SSH: Ensure your SSH key is added to your GitHub account and SSH agent

## GitHub CLI Alternative

If you have GitHub CLI installed, you can create and push to a repository with:

```bash
# Create a new repository and push
gh repo create curly --public --source=. --push
```
