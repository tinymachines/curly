  - GitHub release asset downloading
  - Command-line interfaces for all workflows

- ✅ Build System
  - Makefile with build, test, clean targets
  - Cross-platform build script
  - Dependency checking
  - Support for multiple targets (curly and curly_parallel)

- ✅ Testing
  - Basic unit tests
  - Test runner
  - Memory checking support

## Next Steps

The following items are planned for future development:

### Short-term (Next 2 Weeks)

1. **Parallel Download Enhancements**
   - Add progress bars for parallel downloads
   - Implement retry logic for failed downloads
   - Add bandwidth throttling option
   - Support download resumption for partial downloads

2. **Extended Functionality**
   - Implement file upload with multipart/form-data
   - Support for custom callback functions
   - Add parallel upload capabilities

3. **Improved Testing**
   - Add unit tests for parallel download functionality
   - Add integration tests with real API endpoints
   - Add memory leak tests with valgrind
   - Add test coverage reporting

### Medium-term (Next 1-2 Months)

1. **Advanced Features**
   - Add support for streaming responses
   - Implement request/response interceptors
   - Add proxy support
   - Add HTTP/2 support
   - Create persistent connection pool for parallel operations
   - Implement download queue management with priority

2. **Packaging and Distribution**
   - Create Debian/RPM packages
   - Add pkg-config support
   - Create a shared library version
   - Publish to package repositories

### Long-term Vision

1. **Ecosystem**
   - Create language bindings (Python, Node.js)
   - Develop a web UI for monitoring downloads
   - Build a request/response collection format
   - Create plugin system for custom protocols and processors

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Connection pooling for API requests
   - Asynchronous requests
   - Request batching for API operations
   - Advanced thread management for optimal performance

## Known Issues

1. Memory leak in `set_json_data()` function when sending JSON data - needs to be fixed in next release
2. No support for file uploads yet
3. Need to improve error messages with more context
4. Need to add proper libcurl cleanup for all error cases
5. Limited error reporting for parallel downloads
6. No progress indication during large downloads
7. No bandwidth control or throttling for downloads
8. Limited validation for TSV input format
